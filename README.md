# Selene (AI CLI Agent)

A modular, tool-augmented local AI agent built with Python and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Inference, conversation storage, and document memory stay local; optional integrations such as Google Calendar and Google Tasks contact their provider only after user-authorized OAuth. The agent wraps a customised [Gemma 4](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) model with an autonomous tool-calling loop, real-time streaming output, and a persistent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) vault for long-term document memory.

**Fedora Linux is the primary development and reference platform.** Windows 10/11 are supported natively (no WSL or Unix compatibility layer). See [docs/platform-support.md](docs/platform-support.md) for the full tool and backend matrix.

By default the agent launches a **modern browser-based Web UI** with live streaming, collapsible thinking panels, and an interactive sidebar. The classic terminal interface is still available via `--cli`.

## How It Works — Theory

### The Agentic Loop

Traditional chatbots are stateless request-response pipes: you send a prompt, the model returns text, done. An **agent** adds a decision loop on top. After generating a response, the agent inspects it for **tool-call signals** — structured instructions the model emits when it determines it needs external data or side-effects to answer properly. If tool calls are detected, the agent:

1. Executes each tool (web search, file read, Spotify playback, etc.)
2. Injects the tool results back into the conversation as `tool` role messages
3. Calls the model **again** with the augmented context
4. Repeats until the model produces a final text-only response

This creates an **iterative refinement loop** where the model can chain multiple tools before composing its answer. For example, if asked *"What's the latest Python release and how does its new feature compare to Rust's approach?"*, the agent might:
- Call `web_search` for the Python release
- Call `web_search` again for the Rust comparison
- Synthesise both results into a single coherent answer

```

                        Stream Answer ◀────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tool Calling

The agent uses the **OpenAI-compatible function calling** format supported by Ollama. Each tool is defined as a JSON schema that describes its name, purpose, and parameters. These schemas are sent to the model alongside every prompt, enabling the model to "know" what tools are available and how to invoke them.

When the model decides a tool is needed, it emits a structured JSON object instead of text:

```json
{
  "function": {
    "name": "web_search",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "Python 3.14 release date",
      "include_content": true
    }
  }
}
```

The agent intercepts this, dispatches to the corresponding Python function via a **dispatch table** (`TOOL_DISPATCH`), and feeds the return value back to the model as a `tool` role message. The model never executes code directly — it only emits structured requests that the agent mediates.

When the model emits multiple independent read-only tool calls in the same response, Selene runs the safe calls concurrently and feeds the results back in the original order. Side-effecting tools and dependency-sensitive chains, such as current-date preflights before web search or scraping, remain ordered.

**Why this matters:** The model's training data has a knowledge cutoff. Tool calling allows it to bridge that gap with real-time data, local filesystem access, and system integration — all while keeping execution sandboxed in Python handlers.

### Streaming Inference

LLM inference happens in two phases:

1. **Prefill (prompt evaluation):** The model processes all input tokens in parallel. Cost is proportional to `num_ctx` (context window size) × number of input tokens. This is the "thinking" phase.

2. **Decode (token generation):** The model generates output tokens one at a time, each conditioned on all previous tokens via the **KV cache** (a matrix of key-value attention states). This is the bottleneck for tokens-per-second (tok/s).

The agent streams both phases to the terminal in real-time:

- **Thinking tokens** (from Gemma's `thinking` field) are displayed in dim magenta as the model reasons through the problem
- **Content tokens** are accumulated into a buffer and rendered as rich Markdown using `rich.Live`

To avoid CPU overhead from re-rendering the entire Markdown buffer on every token, the renderer is **throttled** to approximately 12 FPS (~80ms intervals). Tokens still accumulate in the buffer at full speed — only the visual update is debounced.

### RAG Vault — Retrieval-Augmented Generation

The vault system implements a local RAG pipeline for long-term document memory:

```
Documents ──→ Chunk ──→ Embed ──→ ChromaDB
                                      │
                          Query ──→ Embed ──→ Vector Search ──→ Top-K Chunks ──→ LLM Context
```

**How RAG works:**

1. **Chunking:** Documents (PDF, DOCX, Markdown, reStructuredText, plain text) are split into overlapping segments of ~1800 characters. The splitter prefers natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences) over hard character cuts, producing more coherent retrieval snippets.

2. **Embedding:** Each chunk is converted into a dense vector (a list of floating-point numbers) using an embedding model (`embeddinggemma` by default, running locally via Ollama). This vector captures the *semantic meaning* of the text — chunks about similar topics will have vectors that are close together in the embedding space, regardless of exact wording.

3. **Storage:** Vectors and their source metadata (file path, chunk index, character offsets) are stored in [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/). Runtime data lives under `~/.selene-agent/` by default (`.chroma/` for vectors and `vaults/` for files); set `SELENE_DATA_DIR` to relocate both.

4. **Retrieval:** When the agent (or user via `/vault search`) queries the vault, the query text is embedded with the same model, and ChromaDB performs an **approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search** to find the top-K most semantically similar chunks.

5. **Augmentation:** Retrieved chunks are injected into the model's context window alongside the user's question, giving the model grounded, relevant information to draw from.

**Why local RAG?** Unlike cloud RAG services, everything runs on your machine. Your documents never leave your filesystem. The embedding model and vector database are both local — no API keys, no data exfiltration risks.

### Context Window Management

The **context window** (`num_ctx`) is the maximum number of tokens the model can "see" at once — both input and output combined. It's the model's working memory. Larger windows let the model consider more conversation history but come with costs:

- **KV cache memory** scales linearly with context length. For an 8B parameter model at Q4 quantisation, each additional 1K of context costs roughly 32-64MB of memory.
- **Prefill latency** increases with more input tokens.
- If the KV cache exceeds GPU VRAM, it spills to system RAM, causing a dramatic throughput drop.

The agent manages this automatically:

- **Default `num_ctx` is 8192** — sized to fit the model + KV cache entirely in GPU VRAM on consumer GPUs (4-8GB).
- **System prompt persistence** keeps the active model system prompt in every model request. Selene reads the local `Modelfile` system prompt first, then falls back to Ollama's built-model prompt, then to `~/.selene-agent/system_prompt_cache.txt` (or `$SELENE_DATA_DIR/system_prompt_cache.txt`). This makes prompt edits effective at runtime even before the model is rebuilt, while still keeping a durable fallback.
- **System reminder anchoring** adds a compact runtime system reminder near the active user turn while preserving the full system prompt at the front. This helps long conversations retain tool/evidence rules even when the beginning of the context is far away.
- **History trimming and compaction** keep the prompt within the active token budget. Near 75% usage, older turns are summarized and passed through the context optimizer while system instructions and recent exchanges remain intact; hard trimming remains the final bound.
- **Context preflight guards** reserve output space before every Ollama call, including follow-up calls after tools. The guard counts serialized chat messages, the runtime tool schema list, a safety margin, and the requested `num_predict` output budget; if necessary it lowers `num_predict` for that call instead of letting generation run into the end of the context window mid-response.
- **Compact runtime tool schemas** are sent to Ollama instead of the verbose documentation schemas. Function names, descriptions, parameters, required fields, and enums are preserved, but prose-heavy parameter descriptions are stripped because the detailed tool explanations already live in the system prompt and README.
- **Graceful overflow handling** stops before generation if the prompt still cannot safely fit after trimming. In that case Selene returns a controlled warning asking for a narrower request, a fresh chat, or a larger `num_ctx`, rather than producing unstable output.
- Both values can be overridden at runtime via `/set parameter num_ctx <value>`.

## Features

### Core
- **Fully local:** All inference runs through Ollama on your machine. No cloud dependencies for core functionality.
- **Custom model:** Uses a `Modelfile` to wrap Gemma 4 (8B, Q4_K_M quantisation) with a tailored system prompt and optimised sampling parameters.
- **Thinking visibility:** Streams the model's internal chain-of-thought reasoning before the final answer.
- **Dual interface:** Launches the Web UI by default; pass `--cli` for the classic terminal experience.

### Web UI

The default interface — launch with `python main.py` and the agent opens in your browser automatically.

- **Cyberpunk-Obsidian aesthetic** — deep charcoal backgrounds, glassmorphism cards, and neon glowing accents in Cyan, Magenta, Teal, and Amber.
- **Enhanced 3D Elements** — realistic layered shadows (`--shadow-subtle`, `--shadow-heavy`) and tactile hover/active states that simulate physical lift for cards and message bubbles.
- **Context window usage indicators** — visual tracking of the model's context capacity in real time.
- **Live SSE streaming** — tokens and thinking blocks are pushed to the browser in real-time via Server-Sent Events; no polling, no page reloads.
- **Smart generation states** — dynamic site behaviour that intelligently adapts while a response is actively generating.
- **Collapsible thinking panel** — while the model reasons, a dedicated magenta panel shows the chain-of-thought with animated dots. After completion it collapses into a togglable bar (DeepSeek/Gemini style).
- **Interactive tool cards** — each tool invocation renders a visual card: `⟳ Running [tool]` → `✓ Executed [tool]`. Click the header to expand raw JSON parameters and output.
- **Sidebar control panel:**
  - Real-time sliders for `Temperature`, `Top-P`, and `Top-K`
  - System-prompt override with a one-click reset to default
  - Toggles for conversation history and model thinking
  - Automatically saved conversations with agent-generated 2–3-word sidebar titles
  - Save / restore named sessions without leaving the browser
- **Markdown rendering** — responses support headings, emphasis, links, blockquotes, lists, task lists, fenced code with copy buttons, and responsive GFM-style tables.
- **LaTeX symbol rendering** — common commands such as `\oplus`, `\alpha`, `\subseteq`, and `\Rightarrow` render as Unicode outside code spans and fenced code.
- **Responsive layout** — sidebar collapses on narrow viewports; works on desktop and tablet.

### Tool Suite
The agent autonomously decides when to call tools based on the user's query:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Web Search** | Real-time DuckDuckGo search with adaptive depth (easy/medium/hard), plus optional top-result content extraction for current events, docs, and post-cutoff information |
| 🕸️ **Web Scraper** | Fetch and extract readable text, headings, metadata, and optional links from public HTTP(S) pages with byte/character limits and local-network safeguards |
| 🌐 **Browser** | Open URLs or search queries in the system's default browser |
| 💻 **Code Viewer** | Read source files with line numbers; scan directories by extension |
| 🧬 **Codebase Indexer** | Persistently index an entire repository, auto-refresh it after 24 hours, and retrieve grounded code context for architecture questions, fault finding, and optimisation |
| 📄 **Document Reader** | Extract text from PDFs (`pypdf`) and Word docs (`python-docx`) with page/chunk/query navigation |
| 📊 **Spreadsheet Tool** | View, read, search, and create bounded `.csv`, `.xls`, and `.xlsx` files with sheet and A1-range controls |
| 📂 **File Manager** | Stream line ranges, navigate/search bounded text files, and create non-overwriting files auto-vaulted under `~/.selene-agent/vaults/` |

| 🔎 **Vault Search** | Query the vault using vector similarity; resolves friendly aliases automatically |
| 🗑️ **Vault Delete** | Remove indexed entries by source path or delete entire collections |
| 🏷️ **Vault Aliases** | List registered human-friendly names that map to vault collections |
| 📓 **Obsidian Notes** | Create structured Obsidian-optimised notes with YAML frontmatter, WikiLinks, and version control |

| 🧠 **Context Memory Optimizer** | Compact conversations while preserving instructions, recent turns, decisions, constraints, facts, and links |
| 🧭 **Reasoning Chain Debugger** | Audit explicit claim/evidence graphs for unsupported leaps, missing references, cycles, and confidence problems |
| ⚙️ **Automated Routine Executor** | Define natural-language workflow macros, preview their actions, and execute approved local commands/apps/URLs |
| 🚀 **App Launcher** | Launch up to ten installed desktop apps by display name, with confirmation and command-injection safeguards |
| 🕒 **Current Date & Time** | Return the current local date/time or convert it to a requested IANA timezone |
| 💻 **Terminal Launcher** | Open a supported terminal at an existing directory, with explicit confirmation and no command execution |
| 📅 **Google Calendar** | List calendars and upcoming events, search a time range, and create or edit events; deletion requires explicit confirmation |
| ✅ **Google Tasks** | List task lists and tasks, create tasks with notes or due dates, and update status or details; deletion requires explicit confirmation |

Legacy tools have also been hardened for current workloads: web results retain source URLs, code scans skip dependency/cache trees and cap traversal, binary documents route through the document reader, PDF vision runs one page at a time, embedding vectors are shape/number validated, and failed re-indexing preserves the previous good vault records. Set `include_vision=false` on `index_vault` for substantially faster text-only PDF indexing.

### Spreadsheet Tool

Use `spreadsheet` with `action=view` for metadata and bounded previews, `action=read` for a worksheet, A1 range, or value query, and `action=create` to write a new `.csv`, `.xls`, or `.xlsx` file from JSON rows. CSV is treated as one worksheet, supports delimiter detection/selection, and can use the top-level `rows` convenience argument. Creation requires `confirmed=true`, is non-overwriting by default, and treats formula-looking strings as text unless `allow_formulas=true` is explicitly requested.

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "file_path": "reports/scores.xlsx",
  "sheets": [
    {"name": "Scores", "rows": [["Name", "Score"], ["Ada", 10], ["Lin", 9]]}
  ],
  "confirmed": true
}
```

For CSV, pass rows directly and optionally choose a delimiter:

```json
{"action": "create", "file_path": "reports/scores.csv", "rows": [["Name", "Score"], ["Ada", 10]], "delimiter": ",", "confirmed": true}
```

### Codebase Indexer

`codebase_indexer` gives the agent persistent, repository-wide context for architecture questions, implementation tracing, fault finding, security review, and optimisation. Point the agent at a local repository and ask naturally, for example: *“In `/projects/shop`, trace checkout from the HTTP endpoint to the database and identify likely failure points.”*

The tool has three actions:

| Action | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| `query` | Refreshes when necessary, then retrieves the most relevant code and repository-map chunks for the model to analyse. This is the default. |
| `index` | Explicitly indexes or refreshes a repository. Set `force_reindex=true` to bypass the cooldown when querying. |
| `status` | Reports the collection name, last successful index time, age, and next refresh time without indexing. |

Each absolute repository path receives its own stable ChromaDB collection. On the first reference, the tool recursively indexes supported source, configuration, and documentation files, records symbols and line ranges, and builds a chunked repository map. Later references reuse that collection. The first reference after the index becomes 24 hours old automatically refreshes it; this is a rolling 24-hour cooldown rather than a calendar-day reset.

Refreshes update changed files and remove chunks for deleted files. If embedding a particular file fails, its previous valid chunks are retained. Simultaneous first-use queries share a refresh lock so they do not duplicate the full embedding job.

Common dependency, cache, VCS, and build directories—such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, `build`, and `target`—are excluded. A single file is capped at 2 MiB, with repository caps of 5,000 files and 50 MiB of source text. These bounds keep accidental generated trees from overwhelming local Ollama and ChromaDB.

Indexes use the same local embedding model and Chroma storage as the document vault. Refresh metadata is stored in `~/.selene-agent/codebase_indexes.json`; vectors remain under `~/.selene-agent/.chroma/`. `SELENE_DATA_DIR` relocates both.

### Google Calendar and Tasks

The `google_workspace` tool exposes Google Calendar and Google Tasks as two user-facing capabilities through one encrypted OAuth connection.

| Capability | Supported operations |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Google Calendar** | Check connection status, list calendars, list/search events by time range, list upcoming birthdays with annual dates normalized into the requested window, create events, edit events, and delete confirmed events |
| **Google Tasks** | List task lists, list tasks with optional completed items, create tasks, edit titles/notes/due dates/status, and delete confirmed tasks |

Event times accept RFC 3339 date-times or `YYYY-MM-DD` for all-day events. Task due dates accept either form; Google Tasks retains the date portion. Calendar IDs default to `primary`, while task-list IDs default to `@default`. Selene sends attendee updates when an event with guests is created, changed, or deleted.

On first use, Selene opens Google's Desktop OAuth flow in the browser. The OAuth client configuration, access token, and refresh token are stored as AES-GCM ciphertext in `~/.selene-agent/google_oauth.enc` (or `$SELENE_DATA_DIR/google_oauth.enc`). The encryption key is kept in the OS keyring where available, with a mode-`0600` local fallback for headless systems. Refreshed tokens are immediately re-encrypted; credential values are redacted from tool errors.

Setup:

1. Enable the **Google Calendar API** and **Google Tasks API** in a Google Cloud project.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen, create a **Desktop app** OAuth client, and download its JSON outside this repository.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Tell Selene: `Connect my Google account using /absolute/path/to/client_secret.json`.
5. After Selene confirms the encrypted credential was saved, delete the downloaded source JSON.

Example requests:

- `What is on my primary calendar tomorrow?`
- `Create a project review on Monday from 2 PM to 3 PM in Asia/Kolkata.`
- `Show my incomplete Google Tasks.`
- `Add “submit expense report” to my default task list, due Friday.`

### Advanced Tool Safety Model

The advanced tools are deliberately bounded:

- Graph inferences include the exact supporting edge path; the builder does not invent edges from labels.
- Simulation equations use a restricted arithmetic parser—never Python `eval`—and workloads are capped. Forecasts remain conditional on the supplied assumptions.
- API credentials are referenced by environment-variable name rather than passed as literal secrets. Retries, timeouts, response sizes, and failover endpoints are capped.
- Memory optimisation is extractive and reports before/after token estimates. Automatic background compaction uses the same optimizer after generating its factual summary.
- The reasoning debugger audits supplied claims, dependencies, assumptions, and evidence IDs. It does not expose private model chain-of-thought; it produces an accountable evidence graph and Mermaid diagram.
- Routines live in `~/.selene-agent/routines.json` (or `$SELENE_DATA_DIR/routines.json`) so they persist across conversations, application restarts, and upgrades. Existing routines from `.selene/routines.json` are imported automatically. Routine actions can invoke registered agent tools; app actions are dispatched through `app_launcher.py`, including batched `launch_apps` calls. Use `action=show` (or `dry_run=true`) for the required preview of command, URL, and general tool runs, then use `action=run` with `confirmed=true` after user approval. App/delay-only routines can receive persistent approval when defined, allowing an exact saved trigger to run them later without another prompt. Commands use argument arrays with `shell=False` and remain in the project workspace.
- Google Calendar and Tasks use a first-run Desktop OAuth browser flow. The downloaded client configuration and refresh token are then stored together as AES-GCM ciphertext at `~/.selene-agent/google_oauth.enc` (or under `$SELENE_DATA_DIR`). Selene keeps the encryption key in the OS keyring where available; headless systems fall back to a mode-`0600` key beside the ciphertext. The downloaded source JSON is never copied into the repository and can be deleted after authorization.
- App actions accept only installed application display names. Shells, terminals, paths, URLs, command flags, and arbitrary PATH binaries are rejected; all launches are detached and shell-free.

Example simulation model:

```json
{
  "variables": {"inventory": 100, "demand": 12},
  "equations": {
    "inventory": "max(0, inventory - demand)",
    "demand": "max(0, demand + normal(0, 1.5))"
  },
  "steps": 30,
  "trials": 200,
  "seed": 42
}
```

Example routine definition:

```json
{
  "action": "define",
  "name": "morning workspace",
  "routine": {
    "description": "Open Antigravity and VS Code for the morning workspace.",
    "allow_automatic": true,
    "triggers": ["start my morning"],
    "actions": [
      {"type": "open_app", "app_name": "Antigravity"},
      {"type": "open_app", "app_name": "VS Code"}
    ]
  },
  "confirmed": true
}
```

### Terminal Interface
- **Rich Markdown streaming** via `rich.Live` with automatic scroll management
- **LaTeX math rendering** — Greek letters, fractions (`\frac`), roots (`\sqrt`), super/subscripts, arrays, and 220+ symbol mappings converted to Unicode for terminal display
- **Animated spinner** during model loading and thinking phases
- **Session persistence** — save and restore full conversation state including history, parameters, and system prompts
- **Graceful Interrupts** — use `Ctrl+\` to safely stop the model's generation midway while preserving the partial response in your conversation context (leaving `Ctrl+C` free to exit the application).

### Data Flow — Web UI

1. Browser opens automatically at `http://localhost:5005` (or next free port)
2. User message is `POST`ed to `/api/chat`
3. `web.py` builds the Ollama request with the current session's parameters, history, and tool schemas
4. If the model returns tool calls, `web.py` executes them via `TOOL_DISPATCH` and yields SSE `tool_*` events to the browser
5. Thinking tokens arrive as `thinking` SSE events; content tokens as `token` events
6. `app.js` renders tokens in real time, assembles the thinking panel, and builds tool cards
7. On completion a `done` SSE event is fired and the response is added to history

### Data Flow — Terminal CLI

1. **User input** enters the chat loop in `agent/core.py`
2. Slash commands (`/help`, `/save`, `/vault`, etc.) are intercepted and handled locally — they never touch the LLM
3. Natural language input is sent to Ollama with the full tool schema list and (trimmed) conversation history
4. If the model returns tool calls, the dispatch table routes them to the appropriate Python handler
5. Tool results are appended to the conversation and the model is called again
6. Final text output is streamed through the terminal renderer with Markdown and LaTeX processing

## Platform support

| Platform | Role | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Fedora Linux** | Primary / reference | DBus Spotify, desktop entries, XDG paths, GNOME terminals, AppImage |
| **Windows 10/11** | Native secondary | No WSL required; Start Menu apps, Windows Terminal/PowerShell/cmd, LocalAppData runtime |

Authoritative matrix (every registered tool): [docs/platform-support.md](docs/platform-support.md). Contributor architecture rules: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Runtime data paths

Selection order (no silent migration or copy):

1. `SELENE_DATA_DIR` (if set)
2. Existing legacy store `~/.selene-agent` (kept in place when present)
3. Platform default:
   - Linux: XDG data/state/config/cache under the Selene app name
   - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Selene`

### Spotify / PDF notes

- **Fedora:** Spotify uses MPRIS over DBus (`dbus-python` is Linux-only in `requirements.txt`).
- **Windows:** Spotify uses a URI launch backend and never claims confirmed playback.
- **PDF text** works with `pypdf` alone. **PDF-to-image** needs Poppler (`poppler-utils` on Fedora; set `POPPLER_PATH` / `SELENE_POPPLER_PATH` on Windows if needed).

---

## Prerequisites

- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- **Python 3.10+** (CI validates 3.11/3.12; local Fedora hosts may be newer)
- **Gemma 4 E4B model:** `ollama pull gemma4:e4b`
- **Embedding model (for vault):** `ollama pull embeddinggemma`
- **Vision model (optional):** `ollama pull moondream`
- **For Spotify:** Spotify desktop app. On Linux, `dbus-python` is also required (pre-installed on most GNOME/Fedora systems).

---

## Installation

### Fedora

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RahulBiju-dev/AI-CLI-Agent.git
cd AI-CLI-Agent

# Optional: PDF page images (text extraction works without this)
sudo dnf install poppler-utils -y

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure Ollama has the required models
ollama pull gemma4:e4b
ollama pull embeddinggemma
ollama pull moondream   # optional vision

# Non-destructive environment check
python main.py --doctor

# Start the agent (auto-builds the custom model on first run)
python main.py
```

### Windows (native)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/RahulBiju-dev/AI-CLI-Agent.git
cd AI-CLI-Agent
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# dbus-python is skipped automatically via environment markers
python main.py --doctor
python main.py
```

Optional PDF images on Windows: install Poppler and set `SELENE_POPPLER_PATH` to its `bin` directory.

### Multimodal Vision Capabilities
The agent supports memory-safe multimodal vision, allowing it to read slides, diagrams, and architectures from large PDFs without RAM exhaustion.
> **Note:** You MUST run `ollama pull moondream` in your terminal before using the agent with PDFs or images to enable this feature!

### What happens on first run

The agent uses a **staged managed-model lifecycle**: build under a temporary alias, inspect, publish to the live `selene` alias, then record Modelfile hash metadata. It never pre-deletes the live alias. The Modelfile bundles:
- The Gemma 4 base weights
- A system prompt with personality, knowledge cutoff rules, and tool-use instructions
- Conservative sampling parameters aligned with the selected hardware profile

This custom model is cached by Ollama and reused on subsequent runs when the Modelfile hash matches.

---

## Diagnostics

```bash
python main.py --doctor
python main.py --doctor --json
```

Reports Python/OS, runtime paths and writability, hardware profile, Ollama availability, model presence, GPU probe (when safe), tool-registry consistency, optional dependencies, terminal/Spotify capabilities, Poppler, port availability, and packaged resources. Secrets and personal document contents are never printed. Individual check failures do not abort the rest of the report.

---

## Building the Desktop App (Electron)

Selene can be built into a standalone desktop application using Electron and PyInstaller. This bundles the Python backend and web UI into a single executable that you can distribute.

> **Note**: The Ollama engine and models (like Gemma 4) are **not** bundled in the app to keep the file size reasonable. Users must have Ollama installed and running on their system.

### Step-by-Step Build Instructions

1. **Install Node.js & Python dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   bun install
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build the Python Backend**:
   First, compile the Python code into a standalone executable using the provided PyInstaller spec:
   ```bash
   bun run build:backend
   ```
   This creates the backend executable inside the `dist/` folder.

3. **Test in Development Mode (Optional)**:
   You can run the Electron app locally to ensure the backend spawns correctly:
   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

4. **Build the Electron App**:
   Package the application for your operating system:
   ```bash
   bun run build          # backend + Linux AppImage
   bun run build:windows  # backend + Windows NSIS (on Windows hosts)
   ```
   Artifacts use the version from `package.json` (for example
   `dist-electron/Selene-2.2.0.AppImage` or `Selene-2.2.0-Setup.exe`). The
   packaging helper always forces `--publish never`. NSIS uninstall leaves user
   runtime data intact.

   The PyInstaller backend keeps a console for Electron's stdout port-readiness
   contract; Electron launches it with a hidden console on Windows.

## Usage

### Web UI (Default)

```bash
python main.py
```

The server binds to port `5005` (or the next free port) and automatically opens your default browser. You'll land on the chat interface immediately — no configuration required.

> **Port:** If `5005` is occupied the agent finds a free port and launches the browser pointing to that port.

**Sidebar controls** (click `⚙` to open):

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Temperature slider | Adjust response creativity (0.0 – 1.0) |
| Top-P / Top-K sliders | Fine-tune nucleus and top-k sampling |
| System prompt | Override or reset the model's instructions |
| History toggle | Enable / disable conversation memory |
| Thinking toggle | Show / hide the model's reasoning panel |
| Save session | Persist the current conversation with a custom name |
| Load session | Restore any previously saved session |

### Terminal CLI

Pass `--cli` to skip the Web UI and use the classic terminal interface:

```bash
python main.py --cli
```

You'll see the chat prompt:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────╮
│   Gemma CLI Agent  ·  type /help      │
╰───────────────────────────────────────╯

>>>
```

Type naturally. The agent will decide whether to answer directly or use tools. When tools are called, you'll see status indicators:

```
🔍  Searching the web: Python 3.14 new features
✓  Search complete — synthesizing answer…
```

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands (also `/?`) |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history and reset system prompt |
| `/save [name]` | Save session to a JSON file |
| `/load [name\|index]` | Load a saved session (lists available if no arg) |
| `/set parameter <name> <val>` | Set a model parameter (e.g., `temperature 0.7`) |
| `/set system "<prompt>"` | Override the system prompt (use `default` to reset) |
| `/set history` / `/set nohistory` | Toggle conversation memory |
| `/set think` / `/set nothink` | Toggle thinking/reasoning visibility |
| `/set verbose` / `/set quiet` | Toggle generation stats (tok/s, elapsed time) |
| `/set format json` / `/set noformat` | Force JSON output mode |
| `/set wordwrap` / `/set nowordwrap` | Toggle word wrapping |
| `/show parameters` | View active session parameters and flags |
| `/show system` | Display the current system prompt |
| `/show model` | Show model architecture and parameter count (also `/show info`) |
| `/quit` | Exit the agent (also `/exit`, `/q`) |

### Vault Commands

The vault provides persistent semantic search over your local documents:

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/vault list` | `ls` | List indexed vault collections |
| `/vault aliases` | `list-aliases` | List registered vault aliases |
| `/vault alias <name> <coll>` | `register` | Register a friendly alias for a collection |
| `/vault rename <old> <new>` | `mv` | Rename a vault collection |
| `/vault add <path>` | `index` | Index a file or folder into the vault |
| `/vault search <query>` | `find` | Search indexed content for relevant chunks |
| `/vault delete <source>` | `remove`, `rm` | Remove indexed entries by source path |
| `/vault help` | `-h`, `--help` | Show vault command help |
| `/vault add <path> --collection notes` | | Index into a named collection |
| `/vault search <query> --top-k 10` | | Return more results |
| `/vault search <query> --source file.md` | | Restrict search to a specific source |
| `/vault delete --all` | | Delete an entire collection |

**Auto-indexing:** When you paste a file path as input and the file is large (>200KB) or binary (PDF/DOCX), the agent automatically indexes it into its own vault collection before processing. The collection name is derived from the filename (e.g., `DAA_Notes.pdf` → collection `DAA_Notes`).

**Auto-naming:** When no collection name is specified, the vault automatically derives one from the filename or folder name instead of dumping everything into a generic bucket. This means each document gets its own isolated, searchable collection:

| Input | Auto-derived collection |
|-------|------------------------|
| `DAA_Notes.pdf` | `DAA_Notes` |
| `Compression Notes.pdf` | `Compression_Notes` |
| `physics_notes.md` | `physics_notes` |
| Folder `/docs/` | `docs` |

**Auto-vaulting on file creation:** Every file created with `create_file` is saved into `~/.selene-agent/vaults/` by default (using only the basename), indexed into its own ChromaDB collection, and registered with a friendly alias. Existing files are never overwritten. If indexing is temporarily unavailable, file creation still succeeds and reports `indexed: false`.

**Vault Aliases:** Vaults are automatically given friendly aliases derived from the filename. When searching, you can use the original name (e.g., `"physics_notes"`) instead of remembering the sanitized ChromaDB collection name. Aliases are atomically stored in `~/.selene-agent/vaults/.vault_aliases.json`; substring resolution is used only when it identifies one unique collection.

**Multimodal Support:** For PDFs, the agent uses `moondream` via Ollama to generate visual descriptions of diagrams and slides. This is integrated directly into the vault indexing pipeline. Ensure you have run `ollama pull moondream` and installed `poppler-utils`.

### Runtime Configuration

All model parameters can be adjusted without restarting:

```bash
>>> /set parameter temperature 0.8
✓  temperature = 0.8

>>> /set parameter num_ctx 16384
✓  num_ctx = 16384

>>> /set verbose
✓  Verbose mode enabled — stats shown after each response.
```

Available parameters: `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `num_ctx`, `num_predict`, `repeat_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `min_p`, `tfs_z`, `repeat_last_n`, `seed`, `num_gpu`, `num_thread`, `num_keep`.

## Performance Tuning

Selene selects a **hardware profile** at startup (`auto`, `low-vram`, `balanced`, `manual`). When VRAM cannot be measured, or a ~4 GiB class GPU is detected, the conservative **low-vram** profile is used:

| Setting | low-vram (default safeguard) | Purpose |
|---------|------------------------------|---------|
| `num_ctx` | 4096 | Context window — keeps first-turn tool schemas viable on 4 GiB |
| `num_predict` | 768 | Output ceiling |
| `num_batch` | 128 | Prefill batch size |
| model slots | 1 | Serializes chat/embed/vision under the Ollama coordinator |
| tool workers | 2 | Bounded parallel tool execution |

These are **safeguards**, not a claim of measured optimality for every RTX 3050 Ti 4 GB host. Override via environment (`SELENE_PROFILE`, `SELENE_NUM_CTX`, …) or session `/set` commands after reading `python main.py --doctor`.

### Ollama Environment Variables

For additional throughput gains, set these before running `ollama serve`:

```bash
# Enable flash attention (major speedup if supported)
export OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1

# Single user mode (max throughput)
export OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1

# Keep model loaded between requests (note: the agent also sets keep_alive per-request)
export OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m
```

### Memory Budgets (approximate)

| `num_ctx` | Approx. KV Cache | Recommended VRAM |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2048 | ~0.5 GB | 4 GB+ |
| 4096 | ~1.0 GB | 4 GB+ (Selene low-vram default) |
| 8192 | ~2.0 GB | 6 GB+ |
| 16384 | ~4.0 GB | 8 GB+ |

Exact VRAM use depends on model weights, quantization, and concurrent workloads.

> **Rule of thumb:** If your tok/s drops below ~10 for simple queries, your KV cache is probably spilling to system RAM. Lower `num_ctx` until it fits in VRAM.

Runtime data is kept outside the checkout in `~/.selene-agent/` by default. This includes conversations, `routines.json`, `system_prompt_cache.txt`, `google_oauth.enc`, `vaults/`, `.chroma/`, and `codebase_indexes.json`. Override the parent directory with `SELENE_DATA_DIR=/your/path`.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Web UI is the default** — `python main.py` starts the browser interface; the terminal CLI is opt-in via `--cli`. This keeps the richer interface front-and-centre without breaking existing workflows.
- **SSE over WebSockets** — Server-Sent Events are used for token streaming because they need only a standard HTTP connection, require no upgrade handshake, and reconnect automatically on drop.
- **`ThreadingMixIn` HTTP server** — `web.py` uses Python's `socketserver.ThreadingMixIn` so each request (including long-lived SSE connections) runs in its own daemon thread, preventing a slow generation from blocking the session API.
- **Shared `GLOBAL_STATE`** — a single in-process dict holds history and session parameters, making state trivially accessible across request handlers without an external store.
- **Tool schemas are compacted at runtime** to minimise prompt token overhead — detailed descriptions stay in the system prompt/docs, while the schemas sent with each LLM call keep only the callable structure needed for tool calling.
- **Streaming is throttled** at ~12 FPS in the terminal to avoid CPU-bound Markdown re-rendering from bottlenecking the token pipeline. The Web UI receives every token immediately via SSE.
- **All regex patterns are pre-compiled** at module load time in `terminal.py`, not on each rendering pass.
- **History is trimmed** using a conservative serialized-message token heuristic (roughly 1 token ≈ 4 characters plus role/tool overhead), with response headroom reserved before every Ollama request.
- **Vault embeddings** use the local `embeddinggemma` model via Ollama's HTTP API, falling back to the Python client if the HTTP endpoint changes.

## Testing

```bash
python -m compileall . -q
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python main.py --doctor
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs Linux and Windows Python matrices, registry validation, frontend bundle checks, and packaging configuration smoke tests. Tests never download Ollama models or require a GPU, OAuth credentials, Spotify, or GUI interaction.
